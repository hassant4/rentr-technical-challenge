# Rentr Technical Task

At Rentr we are creating the future of real estate. To achieve this, we will be building an online portal for our real estate partners to serve renters applying for our services. It is essential that our portal provides an exceptional experience in the form of world class UI and reliability to both renters and our partners.

## Hiring Process

As part of technical hiring we like to explore building a small module which could be a part of our portal. This allows the candidate to get a good sense of the type of technical challenges that will be faced when building our product.

## The Task

We will be building a small web app which allows renters to apply for our service, and a partner-only admin page to service applications.

Here are the requirements of the web app:

1. Application form for renters to submit their details: First Name, Last Name, Email, Monthly Rent, Annual Salary
2. Partner admin page behind authentication to see existing applications split by ones that need our attention, and ones that don't
3. Ability for authenticated partners to accept / decline applications

## Authentication
1. Only partners should be allowed to see and accept/decline applications
2. You can choose what type of authentication to implement, user/email/pass or pin code etc

## Deployment

1. Please deploy the web app to a hosting service e.g. Vercel (no payment method required)
2. Alternatively, create a docker image for us to deploy locally

## Backend

1. We do not expect you to create a backend from scratch, you may use backend-as-a-service platform e.g. Supabase (no payment method required)

## Delivery of Solution
1. Please provide your solution as a zip file or as a repository on GitHub/GitLab or equivalent

## What we are looking for
* Well written code
* An understanding and ability to explain certain code design decisions

## Notes
* We don't expect a visually stunning solution, but rather we are focused on functionality
* The task should take an evening, not many days to complete
* Contact us if there are any questions
